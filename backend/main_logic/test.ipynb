locations in Portugal with no phones it's then their job to the first team to make it back to me in Porto as always there'll be Rules and Things to follow but you'll find out those very soon the the roads feel bumpy and windy and windy uh which worries me and elevated yes and I don't speak Portuguese but you know what mate me and you walking in in This Together rumor has it you've never won one of these Simon I've I don't win any challenges I'm happy to just get second to be honest I think today is the day oh bro just sit back and relax man enjoy the ride it's Chico time [Music] what is this man of course it is how do we even get here [Music] no well I'm guessing it's not that way no George oh no wow what a VI wow wow where the [\\xa0__\\xa0] are we what's that noise by the way wa wa oh Jesus Christ wao wo W that is actually terrifying no you know like megalophobia thing that's oh my hell absurdly what did you put us there good morning boys good morning yeah [\\xa0__\\xa0] off James so are you going to give us our things or are you just going to stare us I can see how this video is going to go right so we are truly abandoned yeah we are in the middle of bit nowhere mate there's a Logging Company there hey I'm just bambooz of by that thing that's not this is not this isn't even like a massive one it's just like a regular one yeah I think the big ones out right oh I don't like oh God what was that Sam you know when I come to a place like this I always got to take a photo [Music] come on Toby come on give it over mate come on I knew there was another one I knew there was another one I'll take that from you but I have something to give you boys your care package why is there a picture of Josh there's a picture of me me oh look it's got both members of the team on it oh yeah Ethan and me why AR you here it's a nice touch isn't it it's I I think that that was me to be a I'll just there we go it's me [\\xa0__\\xa0] hell it's going to be ages to I get back to the amers oh wow we got Portuguese phrases we can say hola hello that that that that adds up oard thank you but do I trust the rest of these I don't know I am a barata dizzy cockro uh a St that's got to be that's a lie surely that makes it you go people say I'm a stupid idiot know what that sounds like it sounds like I'm a stupid pedo I don't know I think these are all made up for the most part the translations are correct uh except for one phrase on each team Sheet uh which means something very very different uh maybe quite offensive he's not lying to us I think yeah based on Spanish this seems to be yeah aaso the yeah where can about to get little monkeys in the head what what why do we need to know it's chicken soup okay that's got races all right samon today's rules yeah you must use three modes of Transport no method of Transport for more than 1 hour hitchhike and taxi for Max 30 minutes at a time but then but hang on if we so you wa who wa hang on we can taxi for 30 minutes but is a taxi a taxi in a car a is a taxi and a h different they're different yeah they're different yeah you can use a transport more than once you can use a transport more than once oh nice yeah you cannot use transport more than once so we can't reuse that's going to be hit difficult what now hopefully you just heard that Harry Miss read a very key rule uh so get ready for the chaos his team's about to face for the rest of the video oh Sam there's hella tasks Josh and his [\\xa0__\\xa0] lists bro make five people Sue with you swap clothes with your teammate have to wear your bandana I guess so eat a pastel Bata I can do that yes yes get on a tram for at least one stop bring all the items from scavenger hunt list to the Finish Line okay what's the scavenger hunt well we have to get a Portuguese flag a Gallow de barcelos don't even know what that is a Portuguese football item okay that's fine three things easy all right this is all doable oh it's only three items on the scavenger H is it yeah I we can do this joshh Josh you've been reasonable Josh how much do we have 500 think not even oh my God he he stiffed us we got2 200€ 200 what bro that's going to be a struggle to get back on € 200 have to bus right well I I guess it's through the forest through the forest looks like they're going for a children's book right now yay all right we're going to have to look at some signs that's not giving much away okay so if my Portuguese is good well I don't know how good you there's no wait there's QR codes for why is there a Spanish flag it's a Spanish and a Great British [Music] flag and where are we trying to get to oh let's not lose the map as well like we did in Ireland um we're trying to get to Porto right we are they didn't see we we are trying to get to PTO right yeah that's where we came from so Port wait where is PTO is at the top some um Porto is going to be Porto there Porto and we are why don't we could be anywhere we could be in any of these mountainous bits yeah to we are in one of the green bits that's handy okay well let's find someone and ask him okay we need to plan what we're in I think we just start walking where that way we've worked out we use the compass that way is north we want to go that way also that way looks like it's going downhill which is where I believe we need to be going yeah and pretty much every car we've seen has been going that way did you know that this mhm you know what that means uh the place of the fire owl no it means I'm in the thick of it and it goes like this look [Laughter] [Laughter] good okay we're going neither up nor well we're not we're not going down yeah we're going up to a vantage point to try and spot civilization that genuinely is our best bet cuz we if we go the wrong way here we we could walk for kilometers also I think the chances of hitchhiking around here are slim to none there's no way you would pick up like this is not a place people would get lost no it's like an industrial Zone and we're just like pretending to be lost it I wouldn't pick us up this feels like you know the mountains in GTA yeah you can drive the car through the uh yeah imagine we just find like two dirt bikes an AB an abandoned add any any dirt bikes spawn up here see um d see oh you don't know what that means map mapap okay oh yes this fren uh English no English English no we are lost yeah yes no no there's another sign there oh oh a person person yes do you want to do the honors I know your Portuguese is okay okay you got this okay hey hey how you doing um where are we uh uh okay okay pug and wait and we're in Spain [\\xa0__\\xa0] [Music] sake we're in [\\xa0__\\xa0] Spain this is [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] this is not fair we're in [\\xa0__\\xa0] Spain s how is that fair what you reckon Lads think this will do yeah it's all [Music] right yes that's right it's wembly baby 990,000 people be sure to get your tickets Monday 18th of November it's going to be amazing I think we're actually going to get a good view from up here we just need to see civilization but all I see right now is more turbines there's civilization on top oh wow oh just more wind turbine there's a few houses on the hill yeah civilization oh wow civilization we can make it to that town what's that about 100% we can make it to that 8 km about 8 K to a town is that Civilization is that a house there at the bottom of that wind turbine there is um that there no I think it's like a service station for the for the wind but if I look to this town I'm more how just how far is that that's like 10ks that's far as well hang on the sun yeah the sun it's rising where does it rise the sunris is in the East let me think cuz my house the sun sets where I live the sunsets in the West and North was that way right so north east south west but that's that we've gain nothing cuz we already knew that was North yeah yeah so we need to get there yeah and we are there I don't know how to say we need various forms of Transport okay all right all right we better move then do we need anything lift some te uh poito see [Laughter] see I could you don't take one yeah who oh I guess this is how the story goes I'm in a thick of it everybody knows they know me where sow I SK in and that's what I'm talking about I just C 40 sub so I've been from the screen to the ring to the pen to the KY where my w that way the portal now I yeah you're right but I'm just trying to figure out where that puts us in Portugal do we speak to these guys oh just say where are we yeah um where are we do we hit them with the where are we or do we say nearest town and just hope they Point uh H where are we that way this way no oh okay follow okay okay e that's going to come it's the bus okay oh okay okay this way this way this way all right cool ah thank you graas o o so I don't know what he said he but he went driving so I think there's I think there's I'm assuming a bus coming I don't know he said ill IL put to his mouth and why didn't we learn basic Portuguese before we came I should basic Portuguese we look lost he's not saying like your car's up there was he like maybe or maybe he was see if these guys point us on the map cuz he Wen going to point us on the map these guys have finished their work yeah um so s as2 pido oh yes hola S2 pido yeah uh we are therei oh oh okay okay way M that way K perfect thank you so much than okay okay all right 6 km walking we can we can live with that I mean to be fair we could have just used the euro to been like I thought about it but I don't know I it didn't sound I feel like if he was going there he might have off he might yeah I don't want to force him to yeah he's probably on the clock this is crazy that's ridiculous badly pronouncing I am lost to 15 minute journey I wonder how the other boys will get in us what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] is our life I'm happy though we're we we we we know where we are know where we are and honestly in this area there could have been no one yeah thank God they were working today but yeah if people weren't there we did think we we did decide we go this way anyway yeah but we would have been really doing this questioning ourselves and think it actually should we turn around yeah I assume this is going to say like welcome to win turbine Ville population 12 wind turbines let's see what does it say go on give us a lot of information be a good sign [\\xa0__\\xa0] off what are we supposed to do with that did try and flag him oh I don't know they know there's no sign there hello hey bour the thing is I think we could have flagged them with conf think we could have flag them to I bottled it but it's just really it's just it's just awkward is it it is awkward I want tell you what though but do we want to use up our hitch hike now maybe we we we got a 5K walk we may as well just get there and then cuz if we save it yeah cuz true we can we can't use the hitch again and we can only use it for 30 minutes I think I know where we are wow so wait why don't we just ask the person behind us No Nonsense they know nothing uh hola uh where are we on [Music] map oh I think he's kind prepared oh wow he actually knows how to read the map oh my God it's so elegant it's not even blowing anywhere how are you doing this oh there we go here's some I made earlier oh we're on the North Coast oh we're up here and Porto is South there so we've we we've got a lovely Beach holiday on our on our house yeah all we need to do is just jog all the way down that's got to be what quick 5K that does mean we need to cross a massive River oh oh Spanish oh yeah much we made it to Alo actually making distance take aott [Laughter] [Music] no one night on per one night okay we come to yeah come to Nory oh I'm I'm actually really like enjoying the spot we've been dropped in it's pretty cool I we're probably the only people that have ever hiked here yeah it's Nota not very a common tourist attraction iume but yes look at the road did you see look at the cars that's a steady stream of vehicles that is yes civilization yes we're going to do it now I wonder is there a shortcut Harry you up for a little jungle track no no we've it would be fun though it would it has not gone well for other British Lads in recent times I would stick to the path here if I was you that does not foraging through the [\\xa0__\\xa0] Baron Jung that sounds like a great laugh right so that's the river we need to cross and Portugal's on the other side we just have no idea how to actually cross it this is quite nice it is especially considering everyone else is at home freezing their tits off probably raining yeah or it could be sunny we won't know we don't have phones ciao that's ciao it's Italian gr no they say in Spain as well if we need anything just call it so it's Lydia and Jose Matthew Jose Manuel Jose Manuel name a better couple in the world than Lydia the man people in the world ain't nobody going to be as wholesome as them nobody nobody's offering people wafer biscuits random strangers lifts wafer biscuits and extra assistance yeah who don't do that don't we just had a whome moment you're making it wi you're do that don't do that oh my God I think there's something hanging oh not again wait no but there is no not guys no guys it's just a a br rels what the hell why are we oh that is the most scratchy rope

an old lady she looked friendly she definitely would have helped us she would have helped us yeah but the thing about I don't want to waste like I don't want we're 3ks away yeah we're pretty much there now there's no point using up that for a 5 minute Journey okay this is we are now hitting something civilization station doesn't look the most welcoming but it is something no it's more of an

okay adios we're still so far from P but I'm having great no we did the hardest part we found a town we did we did the hardest part is always getting getting from the middle of nowhere to something and it all started with a little hello and we are lost it actually started with a I would say we seed the seed when we said hello on the way down from the steps true you did actually we did and it's only because they looked at you imagine they didn't look at us so this is a secondary school John keep moving this a school cuz you're an an oh great oh do you know it it really felt like we were IRL streamers then just the camera going up to people and oh no go on sue sue for me oh he's currently trying to push a car he seems should we help him oh see see uh no see see adios wow what just happened I don't know I think we just did a good deed I think we just did a side [Laughter] [Music] quest yeah excuse me my car's broken down I have the weit already finished doing the good deed about to walk off and you just sort of just I'm English by the way oh there's a bus going the wrong way yeah let's I like the look at that I'm big fan of that yeah yeah the fact they're operating brilliant oh that's a bus stop oh yeah okay that's a bus stop right cool so we need a bus coming the other way is that a bus stop sign that isn't a bus stop sign that is the most egregious sign thing I've ever seen what else it must be so if we can get to if we get a bus to liera I think when a bus hopefully pulls up from this way we just say Liara Liara he says yes we give him all our money no all our he says no yeah we but then even liar is like now that's a big that's a big enough City that like big yellow like we can we can but I don't want to waste like say say it's only like a I don't know like it's like a 15minute drive and we waste our 4 we got 45 minutes of bus that we haven't used [\\xa0__\\xa0] walk to theara you can always come back to we we'll call a bus if we see one um cool uh what is this oh yeah this this is this is this is doing it practice milking JJ practice getting us a taxi I'm sure we can come to some sort of arrangement 30 is a [Laughter] seene I think that might be a port of some sort oh my God are you a rapper what a port of some sort so am I a what rapper it rhymed I I don't get it what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] how did you not get it I I I don't get it aort of some sort but then he said am I rapper what do I mean like are you a [Music] poet should we see if we can get on a boat [Music] sure matter like how much force that thing's traveling with like big truck like that like yeah there's there's something taped to the wall oh God come on give us something please oh it looks promising as well you know it it's for the wrong side it is the wrong way yeah [Music] um okay so this must be the route right and it only comes at those times oh gosh oh gosh oh wow that scary there that every hour well let's go let's go let's keep going cuz we want to find one on the other side of the road it's going to be on this road as well isn't it like they're they're going to just come up and done this one yeah so there there hopefully there's another stop up here yeah you think right we we pray um oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] was that the bus stop I think that might have been the bus stop we just got to wait for it to come I unless you want to walk to Liara which is not that far about 10ks no we walk from here down to there yeah about 10K 4K I mean we can we' got [\\xa0__\\xa0] all else to be doing like we know a bus comes up this road and we'll just flag it if it comes yeah I'm sure they'll stop like yeah yeah yeah okay cool prohibito accesso God knows what that means right all of the signs are like an hour walk but to be fair I don't know why we'd want to go to a museum yeah why why isn't there a Portugal sign transfer oh yeah oh and all you need to do is scan this QR code great ol uh how how do we uh get to Portugal oh we just go there yeah from what's the time now it is 11:45 so I think we've just missed the 11:30 maybe if we didn't waste time on the gym and with the Drone shots we might have actually made it this is true yeah Al but we also did spend quite a lot of time trying to make some BS players soon no no no no no two two two we actually should have just started walking North we probably could have walked to the we actually definitely genuinely Yeah we actually kind of shagged it but we didn't know where we were so like [\\xa0__\\xa0] fear not we're just in a little lull we give it a minute and something's going to happen before the storm yeah yeah yeah we're about to get we're about chopping down some miles soon I'm sure of it oh dear oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] should just [\\xa0__\\xa0] off into the woods and live our lives oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] oh that does not look appealing did we go back back to Fatima what's the Point Taxi we had our chance we blew it better keep stepping young Ro to short should we go on the right side of the road or stick on the left left is better yeah left's better yeah okay we continue we're here we're here we get the taxi to bino and then we get train as far in as we can towards PTO and then we try and get a bus get a bus maybe yeah and we'll see once we're there that sounds good we've already done one mode of Transport we need two more car like a taxi is different to hit y y we established that the Taxi man we should have taken it h goodbye pavement we are in the we're in the trenches now this is trench work now this is Ser yeah oh what's this is it could it maybe be a restaurant oh no there's something there what what is it so we just stopped for for a beer well what is it this is is this a g what is this this looks pretty cool um is it a hotel the Natural Stone oh it's a stone comp for [\\xa0__\\xa0] sake that's not useful we thought it was going to be like a lovely little cafe stop down have a little cesta I thought I thought it was a little like yeah no it's the Natural Stone it's one Awards as well all right took a little while but we've planned our route yeah we're going to do taxi to I forgot the name of the V Villa roale and then a bus from there as far as we can get for an hour she said it it's like an hour so you never know we might not be able to make it to PTO from there hopefully we can make it close and get tram in that would be sick but what happens if the bus doesn't have any stops wow in in a recent video Harry and Vic stayed on they stayed on they went oh the doors have closed we can't get off and we have it's now hit an hour which I think gives us free rain H okay um uh well I think the boat is coming back so already yeah I think it's a different boat though oh how yeah we're over here oh do we have to where's it wait where is it uhoh I I assume it picks us up from here right no I think we need to go over there but we we can't run over there and it'll pick us up from here no we're going to have to go no J we can't it will drive back over here we have to Sprint straight back again surely all right you stay here I'll go around well one of us makes it to [Music] Portugal at this point I'm ready to sit down and

breeze blocks for Josh we got you a present fell the quaries got you a present we ain't even thought about doing any of the task yet but we we just what task we oh it's another petrol station oh thought you going to laugh at us again I know I'm kind of drawn to Benfica I can't lie especially this black one just remember we are going to Porto yeah so this is perfect oh you you're just deliberately wanting to piss people off I don't know what you're talking about why don't you wear Porto yeah I we benica oh it's okay yeah they're all attached yeah yeah maybe we have to get her um we have clothes but attached can we have clothes uh no it's attached uh no no see well said so we've we've got back to the bus station we have how long do we have how long do we have uh we have half an hour half an hour so we got some food and one of the things on the list was to eat a pastel what he said so yeah all right good I'm not going to lie I wanted to eat this after I've eaten my food sorry I was wanted to take a bite that's ticked off though oh so nice one more bite what are we getting on bus to what we getting bu to okay and then once we're there we should be within like 20 minutes of PTO probably no half hour half an hour but that was on bus half an hour on bus so we actually could get like a on a train yeah train or something and then we get then we're in Porto we do everything else and we could how do you reckon the others are getting them I'm trying to eat my sausage yeah Benfica yes yeah yeah let's go for it sick D there's just more and more coming oh for caner yeah bless

all right three two one s done happy days we did it sick so bus 52 plus 52 gets us near we get near it I hope there's actually a train there imagine I'm wrong and there's no train there's no train there though I we'll message Josh and we'll say we're allowed to get another another one of the same trans we can get another cab for 30 minutes for sure we've already done our three modes of Transport we just need the tram though do need the tram where where are the buses where is anything where's the timetable where's anything that can help us oh no and we're leaving town no no we can't be for the fifth time but we're not leaving F no Fatima we're still yet to hit Fatima that was not Fatima that was not Fatima cuz we we need to we'll see the Church of Fatima this church of f better be something spectacular I've walked 20 km to get to it we should go and pray we need a miracle mate we should go in the [\\xa0__\\xa0] there's no way we win so uh how was that yeah bit bit chaotic a fun lunch time definitely got the sues yeah yeah if anything we have got the football shirts now though although JJ you've already been um told off for wearing a Benfica one in the north of Portugal so well we get to Porto I imagine I'm going to be not so lik H I reckon they'll be on the fence with me oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] we're swapping outfits when we get to [Music] Porto maybe this was my plan all along [Laughter] [Music] the bus is not here and it's currently what time 1:15 the time the bus the bus should be leaving right now two people have told us that it's down here you know what's really frustrating though is so the guy that just stood next to me over there was like oh this is really confusing I'm trying to go to Porto I like me too bro me too and he was like yeah the bus should be leaving any second like we could be on that bus we could just get on that bus and we're good I'm actually very worried now are we on the Red Express though yeah we are the Red Express is the one that goes straight to Porto this is 13 that says 13 I says this isn't us no no he might change that though I'm worried I'm very I'm very worried do you want to just show him and be like hey help is thiss or another bus this is sh okay it's not this bus oh no don't tell me we've missed the bus let me get this straight we asked people how to get the bus to Fatima they directed us to the bus stop we got to the bus stop and for nearly 2 hours we've been walking down the bus route past series of bus stops yeah but there is no bus we've been watching the road the entire time there's not been a single bus no we've seen one going the wrong direction and that's it so we just go and get a shaku now we we we must get we have to get on another mode of trans if we if we fail this video imagine we're walking at 600 p.m. today all we've done is walk no we Des we no we deserve punishment we're uh we're trying to do a sidon abandoned Iron Man Edition no modes of transport only legs we just raw dogged the video we're raw dogging this challenge oh [Music] oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] right so we've just got off the train and if I'm correct we should be about hair well a nice 50 minute Journey so obviously we can't get disqualified because it was on the 1 hour there you go Josh that's even your name what do we need to do we need to get a some we you get a [\\xa0__\\xa0] what have you [\\xa0__\\xa0] yourself what that spell oh it does stink doesn't it it smells like a farm there's another bus coming down please please say 52 52 it's 52 oh my God oh my God we're saved that b is yeah I thought we was screwed I was getting so nervous my tummy was turning I said we couldn't have [\\xa0__\\xa0] this up we're making our way and then hopefully we are literally at the train station get on that straightway we're in Porto oh J we can get sing song Going everybody I'm in the thick of it everybody know oh please tell me there this isn't just a long road to nothingness oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] hell are you sure that wasn't Fatima there was no church right no no we we're going to see the Church of fat now that can't cuz also like that we we just passed BOS and that distance there that's like a that's like a good a lot it's like 5K or maybe we're just walking slower than we I I think Fatima's over the hill are we just walking slower than we think we're walking we're not now we're going a Brisk is Pace are we not yeah Pace has slowed all right let's get going all uphill let's get going come on we're not we're in this to win this or what does that say Val valho fatim no Fatima we've hit Fatima we've hit Fatima we thought we hit Fatima an hour and a half ago we've finally done it Fatima oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] where the [\\xa0__\\xa0] did we go from here bus hey the bus stop there yeah H um okay let's get this map out we were in Civilization and then all of a sudden we're just not we could just maybe walk walk do you realize how far that is okay we've just traveled that distance that's like a third of what we've just done and you want to walk we kind of just need a car to Hedgehog we probably need to check which um do you have the the little bag of things we can so we know which way is north and south how does a compass work okay we're so close on were there the end is in sight I'm I don't eat sweets bro literally had to never are we looking for what are we looking for we looking for Portuguese shirts or Porto shirts mm which ones I got a Portuguese Ronaldo shirt I'm getting okay it's the only bad bit now we just sat sat on a bus for 40 minutes we could be walking 15 km who would do that hang on a minute does what is that is that does that mean we've left Fatima [Music] oh no it's built there's a sign up there's signs up there we'll be fine come on come on Fell we can't quit now we got this boss I'm joking I'm joking come on let's keep stepping I've never se you leap up quicker my life oh not there a bus stop where oh there is a fantastic the world's worst this is the world's worst bus service I can't believe how shy this is Portuguese bus is are oh my very I can already hear Josh's voice overs so as the other boys make it into their second town and start doing challenges Vick and Harry are still walking out of the quaries and Miles Vick and Harry are still walking out of the quaries JJ and George attempt to dabble in some hitchhiking car coming this way how do we do it is it this that's yeah but that's that guy's driving that way we we pick up here going this way oh that way [\\xa0__\\xa0] hola cool no he does not care he did not give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] there is no cars going the way that we want to go no first things first is we find the train station for sure cuz you never know how often the trains are the train station find the time and then we can look around if we need to leave straight away you got to leave straight away yeah 100% we're off got I hope I hope we're in the right place okay so this is the town of penis Ville huh philipis where do we go we're walking but I don't know if it's the right way this doesn't real though yeah it looks like it's looks like it's like a painting like they're stuck on the front of there yeah yeah yeah do you know where the train is train TR uh no uh all right what does this say this is make a break now do you know it's not only been about 15 km it's 15 km just slowly and gradually uphill Lisbon BTO PTO we're on the road to BTO we're on the way there way to Port oh my God okay there's no way BMW over bro where the [\\xa0__\\xa0] do we look at where we are but maybe this isn't a common route maybe that maybe the bus just starts in F and goes somewhere like maybe there's no there's no reason to go down there yeah [\\xa0__\\xa0] all out there to we didn't see anyone else Wai at the bus stops even Donald's Fatima oh yes Fatima this way come on eight 8 minutes that's an 8 minute drive oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] all right half an hour to McDonald's let's go let's get it man right now keep

just about we're currently at here and we're going we're going up to here which is on the way to there it's pretty pretty conveniently on the way and it has a train link as well yeah we're kind of following what a train would do which potentially Works we're just yeah we're locked in now man we're just you know what we're just waiting and hoping things happen and by the way also just to remind
